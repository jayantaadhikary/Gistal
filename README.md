## Gistal: Text Summarization

Gistal is a web application (currently in development) that allows user to paste text or upload PDF files (not yet) and get a summary of the content.
The Web-app is built using Next.js.
Currently summarization is done using the Llama3 and Mistral models, which are hosted on an Ollama server.
